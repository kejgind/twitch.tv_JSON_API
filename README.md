# `twitch.tv` JSON API

This is simple implementation of freeCodeCamp's Front-end Project -> `twitch.tv` JSON API.

For this application to work you need to get API key for twitch.
You can get it from [twitch developer site](https://dev.twitch.tv/get-started).
After that in `./app/scripts` folder, create a file `clientID.json` and create `"key":"value"` pair, like `"twitchID": "your key in here"`.

With everything in place you're good to go.
